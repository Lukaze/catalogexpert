# CSS Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The CSS has been refactored from a single large file into a modular architecture for better maintainability, performance, and organization. The new structure separates concerns and makes it easier to maintain specific features.

## File Structure

```
css/
├── base.css                 # Core styles, variables, reset, global utilities
├── header.css              # Header and navigation components
├── search.css              # Search functionality and controls
├── search-results.css      # Search results grid and app tiles
├── entitlements.css        # Entitlement visualization and components
├── entitlement-states.css  # State cards, filtering, and analysis
├── modals.css              # Base modal styles and animations
├── modal-tabs.css          # Modal tabs and Definition tab (NEW)
├── state-modals.css        # State reference and details modals
└── loaders.css             # Loading states and progress indicators

main.css                    # Main file that imports all modules
```

## Benefits of Modular Architecture

1. **Better Organization**: Related styles are grouped together
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller files are easier to navigate and edit
3. **Better Performance**: Only load what you need (future optimization)
4. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
5. **Reduced Conflicts**: Less chance of CSS conflicts and overwrites
6. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a specific purpose

## Usage

The main CSS file (`main.css`) imports all modules using `@import` statements:

```css
@import url('css/base.css');
@import url('css/header.css');
/* ... other imports ... */
```

Include in HTML:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Keep modules focused**: Each CSS file should have a single responsibility
2. **Use consistent naming**: Follow the existing naming conventions
3. **Document changes**: Update this README when adding new modules
4. **Test imports**: Ensure all @import paths are correct
5. **Remove validation-test.css**: Remove before production deployment

## Migration Notes

- Original `styles.css` (1988 lines) split into 10 focused modules
- All functionality preserved
- HTML files updated to use `main.css`
- Validation page updated to use modular CSS

## Future Improvements

1. Consider CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
2. Implement CSS-in-JS for dynamic styling
3. Add CSS purging for production builds
4. Consider CSS modules for component isolation

## Performance Benefits

1. **Modular Loading**: Browsers can cache individual modules separately
2. **Maintainability**: Each file focuses on specific functionality
3. **Development**: Easier to locate and modify specific styles
4. **Build Optimization**: Can optimize/minify individual modules
5. **Debugging**: CSS issues isolated to specific modules

## Responsive Design Strategy

All modules follow a mobile-first approach with:
- Base styles for mobile (320px+)
- Tablet breakpoint (768px+)
- Desktop breakpoint (1024px+)
- Large desktop (1440px+)

## Color System

Consistent color variables defined in `base.css`:
- Primary: #4f46e5 (Indigo)
- Success: #10b981 (Emerald)
- Warning: #f59e0b (Amber)
- Error: #ef4444 (Red)
- Gray scale: 50-900 variations
- Audience-specific colors for R1-R4 groups

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Styles
1. Determine which module the styles belong to
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Use CSS custom properties for colors and spacing
4. Ensure responsive design
5. Add hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Modifying Existing Styles
1. Locate the appropriate module
2. Check for dependencies in other modules
3. Test across all breakpoints
4. Verify accessibility compliance

### Creating New Modules
1. Follow the existing module structure
2. Add import to `main.css`
3. Document the module purpose in this README
4. Ensure no style conflicts with existing modules

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- CSS Custom Properties support required
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
